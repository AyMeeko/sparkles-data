This repo will serve to host data used to populate historical versions of a Twitch subscription wall.

This data is collected via Twitch chat and is generally available, but as I'm collecting it into one location, I decided to encrypt it so that it hopefully can't be used for untoward uses.

The frontend that fetches this data lives at e.g. https://negaoryxsubathon.fun/sparkles/2025-07
